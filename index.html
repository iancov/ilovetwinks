                        The following essay details the research, background, and concept of Twink '25. It should
                        be noted that I am writing from my personal perspective, and although my
                        thoughts have been considered intentionally, they are not factual, and may not be
                        “correct.” As the reader, I ask you to consider my musings critically, and keep in
                        mind that I am viewing this work through a lens that is colored by my unique life
                        experiences and contextual surroundings.

                        <br>
                        I can imagine myself walking up to the CVS counter at the age of 15 or so. My
                        pubescent eyes beaming toward the pharmacist, who happens to be one of my
                        peers. She’s a blonde, girlypop classmate of mine, with a Snapchat addiction and
                        a step-father. She looks at me cautiously, as if to say that she will take me under
                        her popular-high-school-girl wing, but only if I accept her decree. She hands me
                        a crinkly brown paper bag containing an orange tube of pills. The precious Twink
                        pills. With one swallow, I am suddenly assigned the historically significant and
                        hotly contested classification of Twink.

                        <br>
                        Googling the word Twink results in the following definition:
                        twink | noun
                        (among gay men)
                        a gay or bisexual young man with a slim build and youthful appearance.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When the popular-high-school-girl calls her gay-boy-classmate a Twink, she is
                        unknowingly referencing a storied history of language patterns, sexual trends,
                        and cultural class shifts. How has it become that Twink rests in the vocabulary of
                        the average heterosexual teen? And why are they so excited to say it? Through
                        my research and commentary, I investigate both how we got here, and my potential critical response to this phenomenon.

                        <br>
                        In 1977, artist Hal Fischer took upon the noble task of documenting what he
                        entitled Gay Semiotics, a collection of nonverbal communication points that were
                        used by the gay community in San Francisco to identify and broadcast not only
                        their sexuality, but their availability, interests, kinks, and more. For example, placing a blue handkerchief in one’s left pocket indicates that one is interested in
                        taking on the active role of sexual intercourse with other men (“topping”). Moving
                        that handkerchief to the right pocket indicates interest in bottoming. This language is also referred to as the Hanky Code or Flagging. Beyond the Hanky Code,
                        Fischer’s research included other symbols such as wearing one earring on either
                        ear or jangling a set of keys from a belt loop. These modes of communication
                        were understood by gays and indiscernible to straights, allowing a vibrant cruising culture to fly under the radar of the dominant, oppressive eye.
                        Beyond these choices in accessory, Fischer also denoted five archetypes that he
                        claimed represented the interests and visual ideals of the gay male community at
                        the time. They were: Classical, Natural, Western, Urbane, and Leather. Some of
                        these archetypes might be most noticeable to the average straight person in the
                        costuming and performance style of The Village People, famous for their song
                        “YMCA.” Although Fischer did not mention the existence of Twinks at this time of
                        his research, this work can be viewed as a clear example of a developing subconscious gay language. Through an erotic game of self-expression, gay men have
                        historically reinforced stereotypical classifications in order to advertise themselves
                        to others in their community. When your primary mode of finding other people like
                        you must be stealthy, then you may resort to becoming a caricature of what you
                        think they will be attracted to, so as to increase your chances of developing relationships and sexual encounters.

                        <br>
                        Understanding how and why gay men often seem to automatically categorize
                        themselves is important when investigating the birth of the term Twink. In May of
                        2018, then-famous Twink youtuber Connor Franta so eloquently, and teleprompter-ly, explained the origins of the term. In front of soft pink-and-blue lighting, he
                        strings along the same handful of tidbits that every attempted entomologist of the
                        term has access to. It goes a little something like this:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1. Nobody truly knows the origins of “twink”
                        <br>
                        2. “twink” usage came about during the mid-20th century
                        <br>
                        3. In Great Britain, “twank,” was sometimes used to describe gay men
                        <br>
                        4. In the US, “twinkle toes” began popping up as an insult in the 1950s
                        <br>
                        5. At the same time, “twink” began to describe anything shiny and new
                        <br>
                        6. Many also mis-attribute the origins to the snack cake “twinkies”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Regardless of its scattered history, Twink as a word floated into more regular
                        usage throughout the 80s and 90s. By this point, the definition was more-or-less
                        locked down. A Twink was a gay man, who appeared to be young, slim, and on
                        the more feminine side. Most commonly, it also accounted for attractiveness and
                        whiteness. These attributes were assisted by the proliferation of internet porn and
                        gay porn categories.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Alongside this linguistic growth, however, was an acute loss in life and culture at
                        the hands of the AIDS epidemic. Prior to this time period, historically gay, black,
                        and latine neighborhoods in New York City thrived on a communal sharing of
                        progressive ideas, art, and sex. As the AIDS epidemic began to wage war on
                        these communities, bolstered by the deliberate inaction of the government, a
                        geographical and cultural gentrification took place. Gay culture, which routinely
                        feeds the greater pop culture (often with biased or absent credit), was sanitized in
                        favor of the dominant conservative class ideals. As the ubiquitous Fran Lebowitz
                        adage states: “The first people who died of AIDS were artists. They were the most
                        interesting people.” This effect on gay culture is crucial to an understanding of
                        how Twink became a commercialized identity in the social consciousness a few
                        decades later.

                        <br>
                        <span class="p3">Twink Boom</span>
                        <br> 
                        Fast-forward to the year 2018. On May 14th, writer Nick Haramis published an
                        article in the New York Times titled Welcome to the Age of the Twink. This article
                        quickly became an infamous piece of literature in the gay community and set off
                        a chain reaction that would shift social awareness of Twink on a grand scale. I am
                        calling this period the Twink Boom. In his article, Haramis postures that a new age
                        is upon us: the age of thin, artsy-looking men, with bouncy hair and cutting bone
                        structure – a group of men he labels as Twinks. He primarily bases his argument
                        on the success of the movie Call Me By Your Name, starring Timothee Chalamet.
                        Haramis claims that the driving force behind a larger interest in so-called Twinks
                        such as Chalamet is shifting attitudes in young women, who are less interested in
                        “toxic masculinity,” and more interested in soft, sensitive men. Haramis goes on
                        to mention other celebrities who were on his Twink list at the time, such as actors
                        Tye Sheridan, Lucas Hedges, and Nick Robinson. He also throws a bone to a few
                        other more outwardly queer-presenting celebs, including textbook Twink singer
                        Troye Sivan (albeit he misspelled his last name as “Silvan”).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Many readers considered Haramis to be mis-defining and mis-appropriating Twink
                        as a concept. His list of modern-era “Twinks” was composed mainly of straight
                        actors, many of whom did not express any of the personality-based characteristics historically required to be entered into the Twinkhood. What they did have
                        was an appealing look that could be sold to mass audiences. Readers felt that
                        Haramis was applying the Twink label to any skinny and vaguely attractive man
                        in pop culture at the time. He was accused of disregarding the historically queer
                        cultural underpinnings of Twink in favor of a watered-down, heterosexual-friendly
                        version of the word.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Haramis’s article prompted multiple editorial responses in quick succession. Writing for The Atlantic, the day after the release of the Times article, journalist Spencer Kornhaber summarized the controversy and expanded upon why Haramis’s
                        article fell short. He attributed the phenomenon of the “Age of the Twink” instead
                        to a more general shift in popular culture. Simply put: people were becoming
                        more comfortable with picking apart men’s bodies in the ways they had done to
                        women for so long. This perspective is useful when analyzing what it is that made
                        the Twink archetype, albeit a mis-identified one, appealing to straight audiences.
                        Haramis’s article posed it as something new and harmless: a little piece of gay
                        culture that straight people get to hold on to for a bit, and perhaps an opportunity
                        to playfully dissect the bodies of up-and-coming male sex symbols. However,
                        this one-sided use of Twink fails to acknowledge an entire history of desirability
                        politics that rest underneath.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The next day, writing for Them (a week before their YouTube release of Connor Franta’s Twinkfomercial), journalist Mikelle Street interviewed Dr. Jonathan
                        Katz, an influential historian and scholar of queer art. Katz explained that these
                        Twink identifiers – slimness and youth being the most common – have actually
                        been around and sought-after for centuries. Twink sensibilities can be traced all
                        the way back to the ancient Greek practice of pederasty, where male sexuality
                        operated along the lines of a power-based relationship, with a young Twink boy
                        being the object of utmost desire. The article also expanded upon the exclusionary nature of the term, as many trends in desirability typically revolve around
                        whiteness and class. The Twink club was originally reserved for those who were
                        only white and blonde, eventually opening up to Asian men, and slowly moving
                        toward acceptance of Black men. While the linguistic history of Twink may begin
                        within the past century, the historical foundations of something as ubiquitous
                        as a beauty standard run deep. So, while the Twink Boom may have posed the
                        sanitized Twink as the best thing since sliced bread, it perhaps was closer to an
                        old moldy loaf placed in new packaging. These considerations, none of which
                        were present in Haramis’s article, are necessary when coming to terms with what
                        Twink means and how it operates in the present-day.

                        It is also worth noting that the discussions surrounding Twink as an archetype in
                        the entertainment industry are extremely contemporary when compared against
                        the landscape of the gay club. Five years before the Twink Boom, gay writer
                        Thomas Rogers described many of his experiences while clubbing and hooking-up where he was called a Twink as a pejorative. He writes, “Calling someone
                        a ‘twink’ has become an easy way for a gay man (and now, straight people) to
                        prove that he is manlier, smarter, more tasteful or successful than the person he is
                        talking about.” Rogers’s unfavorable experiences and analysis of the word give us
                        a glimpse into a vastly different portrayal of the Twink archetype when compared
                        against the artsy, attractive, and mysterious Twink that Haramis claimed was on
                        the rise just five years later. Twink means something different depending on who
                        says it and to or about whom.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Haramis’s article and the discourse that followed created a sudden, massive
                        increase in public awareness of Twink as a concept in early 2018. It primarily
                        affected straight people, whose awareness of gay culture was digested only
                        through a post-AIDS entertainment industry, and young people, whose burgeoning identities were being rapidly influenced by access to the internet and social
                        media. This rise in Twink usage – whether it was correct usage or not – is what
                        I am referencing when I mention the Twink Boom. It was a perfect storm of circumstances. All of the sudden, anyone could learn about what a Twink was, from
                        conservative mothers to the aforementioned popular-high-school-girls. It allowed
                        Twink to take on a new, commercialized life, often at the disregard of queer historical politics, and to the dismay of those who reveled in the previously exclusive
                        nature of the Twinkdom.

                        We are now in the year 2025. It marks our collective entrance into the next
                        quarter of the 21st century, and it marks a full seven years since 2018. If we
                        take into account the (untrue) myth that your body replaces all of its cells every
                        seven years, then we are all about to be born-again for the first time since the
                        Twink Boom. Perhaps Twink could also be born again.

                        Twink usage has undoubtedly grown since 2018, especially with the advent of
                        TikTok, the expanding social capital of Gen-Z, and the post-post-post ironic state
                        of humor and trends in pop culture. Twink has achieved a seeming ubiquity. However, it has been morphed into a confused existence, one that results in rampant
                        misuse. I think there is room for a new era of Twink to be upon us. One that is
                        explored and upheld by Twinks themselves and the communities that they inhabit,
                        and not by New York Times writers or billionaire advertisers. I will never claim to
                        be a superhero (or superTwink) of any community. However, I do think that I have
                        the ability as a designer to create interesting work that responds to the marred
                        history and social understanding of what it means to exist in the Twinkdom.

                        Drawing from combinations and permutations of my own experiences and
                        research, Twink '25 responds to the baggage outlined in this essay,
                        and attempts to carve out a new Twink niche, one that both calls upon the
                        historically queer, DIY, communal aspects of the culture from which it came, and
                        one that forges ahead to explore new Twink territory.

                        The great philosopher Hilary Duff once said, “when you say ‘that’s so gay,’ do you
                        realize what you say?” I am here to ask a more specific question: When you say
                        “Twink,” do you realize what you say?

                        Gay guys doing gay guy things. Twink '25 is Ian Covert’s long con to gain as much attention as possible by forcing everyone to consider what it means to be a Twink. Are you a twink? Do you know one? Doesn’t matter. The sacrificial stereotype serves as a jumping off point, exploring what it means to exist as a resident of a hyper-specific category.
